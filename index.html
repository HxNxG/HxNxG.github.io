        <h1>Hellow world</h1>
        <p>I'm hosted in github pages</p>
        <p>During my second year at Escuela Polit√©cnica Nacional (EPN) in Ecuador, I've been delving into diverse hobbies and studies. 
            I'm enthusiastic about calisthenics and, despite the initial challenges, I'm determined to enhance my skills in it. 
            Additionally, I enjoy climbing and trekking across the stunning landscapes of my country. In my spare time, 
            I indulge in photography, strive to master the guitar, engage in gaming, and delve into programming languages such as 
            C++, Arduino, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I'm working on a 2L manual compressor, a step-down 
            transformer, an AC-DC power source, and a temperature-pressure sensor device using an Arduino Uno and a BMP280 sensor.
            Future projects on my radar include an audio amplifier, a weight loader piston, and a metallic structure for calisthenics. 
            Alongside my studies, I share my knowledge in subjects like Simple Arithmetic, Algebra, Linear Algebra, Calculus 1, 
            Ordinary Differential Equations, Physics, Statics, Dynamics, and Mechanics of Materials, aiming to become an 
            independent student while supporting my family. Ultimately, my ambition is to excel as a mechanical designer, exploring 
            opportunities in aerospace engineering and renewable energy. Additionally, inspired by my love Tami, 
            I'm drawn towards fields like biomechanics, vibrations, artificial intelligence, and signal analysis,eager to dive
            deeper into these fascinating domains.</p>
